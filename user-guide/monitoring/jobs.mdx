The **Jobs** page provides a detailed view of every job that has been created on the platform. Jobs are generated when a workflow is triggered and they serve as containers for one or more tasks.

## Jobs List Overview

Each row in the table represents a job instance and includes:

- 👁️ **Action**: View job or cancel it.
- 🆔 **ID / Key**: Unique identifiers for tracking.
- 🟡 **Status**: Current state (e.g. `STARTED`, `DONE`, `REJECTED`).
- 📈 **Progress**: How many tasks are completed versus pending.
- 🔄 **Workflow**: The workflow that initiated the job.
- 👤 **User**: The user or entity associated with the job.

You can **sort**, **search** and **filter** jobs easily using the top controls.

## Expanding a Job

Click the arrow icon (▾) next to a job to expand its **task list**.

- The "Tasks Todo" panel shows the pending or active tasks.
- You can see task order, assigned actions, task IDs and statuses.
- If real-time tasks are enabled (e.g., `Talk to AI-Agent`), you can **Connect** directly from here.

Once a job is created, clicking on it opens a detailed view to inspect its current state, metadata and full history.

### 🧾 Header Summary

- **Job ID & Key**: Uniquely identifies the job instance.
- **Status**: Indicates if the job is `STARTED`, `DONE`, `CANCELED` or `REJECTED`.
- **Expiration Warning**: If the job has passed its validity period, a red notice appears.


### 📂 Tabs Explained

The view includes multiple tabs to inspect various aspects of the job:

#### 1. **Progress**
Shows task completion progress. Example: `1 / 1` means one task expected, one completed.

#### 2. **Info**
Displays:
- **Customer Details**: Name and basic metadata.
- **Language and External Reference**: Shows language used during the job (e.g., `EN`).
- **Timeline**: Shows `Created` and `Started` timestamps.
- **Notifications**: Launchpad and LoginCode alerts (if triggered during the job).

#### 3. **Data**
Used to inspect runtime input/output data and system config related to the job. This includes transcripts, LLM usage and job-wide metadata.

#### 4. **History**
Chronological record of all major events (e.g., job creation, status changes, cancellations).


> The Job Details page is your primary source of truth for understanding what happened in a job — from start to end, including the customer, actions, tools and decisions taken by the system or agent.


## Job Status Types

Jobs can be in one of several statuses:

- `NEW`: Created but not started yet.
- `STARTED`: Actively running.
- `DONE`: Successfully completed.
- `CANCELED`: Stopped manually or by rule.
- `REJECTED`: Rejected by an agent or validation logic.

You can track these on the **Dashboard** for trend monitoring.
