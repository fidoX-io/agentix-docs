The **Dashboard** is your central command center in Agentix cPanel. It provides real-time visibility into platform usage, job progress and action distribution — helping managers track performance and troubleshoot issues quickly.

## 📊 Summary Metrics

At the top of the dashboard, you’ll see key counters:

- 🧑‍🤝‍🧑 **Users**: Total number of active users in the platform.
- ⚡ **PowerLinks**: Number of PowerLinks installed and available.
- 🟪 **Actions**: Total defined actions across all PowerLinks.
- 🧩 **Workflows**: Number of workflow definitions created.

These give a quick sense of platform scale and automation coverage.

## 📈 Job Activity Chart

The **Jobs graph** visualizes the lifecycle of all jobs over the past 30 days. It includes:

- 🔵 **New Jobs**: Jobs that were created but not yet started.
- 🟡 **Started Jobs**: Jobs actively running or being handled.
- 🟢 **Completed Jobs**: Successfully finished jobs.
- ⚫ **Canceled Jobs**: Jobs manually stopped before completion.
- 🔴 **Rejected Jobs**: Jobs that were intentionally declined by agents or rules.

Hovering over any point shows a tooltip with the daily count of each job type — great for spotting trends or bottlenecks.

## 🧠 Tip

Use this dashboard daily to:

- Monitor operational health
- Spot failure patterns (e.g. spikes in rejections)
- Estimate system load across time

If you're seeing unexpected dips or spikes, drill down by visiting the **Jobs** and **Tasks** monitoring sections.
