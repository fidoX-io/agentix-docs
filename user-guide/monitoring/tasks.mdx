The **Tasks** section lets you inspect every individual task executed within a job. Tasks represent specific interactions handled by agents, including AI conversations, media display, tool invocations and more.

## Tasks List Overview

The top section displays a searchable and filterable list of all tasks, with key information like:

- **Task Key**: Unique ID for the task.
- **Action**: Linked action (e.g., “Talk to AI Agent”, “MCP Agent”).
- **Job Key**: Parent job the task belongs to.
- **Created On**: Timestamp of task creation.
- **Status**: Task progress (e.g., `STARTED`).

Each row can be expanded to reveal full task details.

## Task Details Panel

Upon expanding  a task, you can review:

- **Input**: Parameters passed into the task (if any).
- **Output**: Execution results including, as example:
  - Transcripts
  - Token usage
  - TTS/STT durations
  - Model and provider details
- **Config**: System-level runtime configuration of the task (useful for debugging).
- **Timeline**: Creation and start timestamps.
- **Task Actions**: A real-time log of tool executions (e.g., `show_media_to_user`) with origin/destination info and timestamps.

## ✅ Common Use Cases

- 🧪 **Debugging tool behavior** (see which tool was called, when and by whom).
- 📊 **Reviewing AI output** (e.g., conversation transcripts and LLM statistics).
- 🛠 **Understanding configuration** passed to the agent during execution.
- 👀 **Auditing** real-time activity and ensuring workflow correctness.

> Tasks are the atomic building blocks of the job execution system. They give full observability into what happened, when and how.
