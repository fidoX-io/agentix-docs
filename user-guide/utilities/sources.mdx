Sources enable agents to access external data, static content, or dynamic inputs during a task. They are centrally defined and assigned to agents per action, allowing flexible access to files, records, and forms across workflows.

<Info>
Sources are globally managed and reusable across different workflows and agent assignments.

## Types of Sources

<CardGroup>

<Card title="üìÅ Static Files" size="md" href="#static-files">
Upload files like PDFs, images, Excel, or DOCX that can be previewed by agents or shown to users during a task.
</Card>

<Card title="üìö Knowledge Base (RAG)" size="md" href="#knowledge-base">
Index content from files, URLs, or text and allow agents to query this data using retrieval-augmented generation (RAG).
</Card>

<Card title="üìù Forms" size="md" href="#forms">
Define interactive HTML forms to collect user input during tasks, shown dynamically to the user by the agent.
</Card>

## Static Files

Static files are uploaded assets that can be shown to the user or previewed by the agent as part of a task. Common file types include:

- Images (PNG, JPG, etc.)
- PDFs
- Excel sheets
- DOCX or text documents

These files are **ready to use immediately** once uploaded.

<Check>
Static files do not require processing ‚Äî they are usable as soon as they‚Äôre uploaded.
</Check>

## üìö Knowledge Base (RAG) 

Knowledge Base sources enable agents to perform contextual search using retrieval-augmented generation (RAG). This allows an agent to answer user questions based on:

- Uploaded files (PDF, TXT)
- Website URLs
- Raw pasted text

Each knowledge source goes through a background indexing pipeline and may have the following statuses:

| Status | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| `draft` | Newly created and not yet processed |
| `processing` | Currently being indexed |
| `ready` | Available for use by agents |
| `failed` | Indexing failed due to format or content issues |

<Info>
Agents can only query RAG sources once the status is `ready`.
</Info>

<div id="forms"/>
## üìù Forms 

Forms allow you to collect structured input from users during a conversation. These are defined using valid HTML `<form>` markup and rendered to the user inline during a task.

<Check>
Forms must include a valid `<form>` element and can contain any HTML inputs (text fields, dropdowns, radios, etc.)
</Check>

### Example

```html
<form>
  <label for="id">Enter ID Number:</label><br/>
  <input type="text" id="id" name="id" required /><br/>
  <button type="submit">Submit</button>
</form>
```

The agent can reference the submitted values and decide how to proceed ‚Äî for example, validating a document or continuing a transaction.


## Source Readiness Matrix

| Source Type | Input Format | Readiness Rules | Agent Usage |
|-------------|--------------|------------------|--------------|
| Static Files | Image, PDF, Excel, DOCX | Immediately ready once uploaded | Preview or display |
| Knowledge Base | PDF, TXT, URL, Text | Must reach `ready` status | Queried for RAG |
| Forms | HTML form block | Must be valid HTML | Rendered to user |

</Step>

<Step title="Add Your Input">
- Upload file / paste text / insert HTML form
</Step>

<Step title="Save and Tag">
Give your source a name and optional tags. For RAG, wait for `ready` status before using.
