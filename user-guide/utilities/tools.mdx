Tools enable agents to **take actions** during conversations â€” like showing media to the user, collecting documents or submitting tasks. Tools are assigned to each agent in the PowerLink configuration.

<Info>
Tools are isolated by action â€” each agent only has access to the tools granted in that assignment.

## ðŸ§° Built-in Tools

Agentix comes with a variety of built-in tools that can be enabled per agent. These tools support key use cases like user interaction, task control and system integration.

<img src="/user-guide/images/tools-builtin.png" alt="Built-in Tools" className='rounded-xl my-6 shadow'/>
Build In Tools includes 2 categories:
- Tools executed at Agent-Side
- Tools executed at User-Side using RPC protocol

### Example of available Built-in Tools - Executed at Agent-Side
These tools are executed by the agent itself, allowing it to perform actions like searching the internet or showing media to the user.

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title="search_internet" icon="globe" description="Performs web searches to find real-time information from the internet">

## ðŸ”Œ MCP Tools

MCP (Model Context Protocol) tools allow you to connect your agent to external APIs or microservices that expose callable tools. These tools are defined and served by an MCP server.

### How MCP Tools Work

1. Define and run your MCP server (in Python or Node.js)
2. Each tool is defined with:
   - Tool name
   - Description / Usage Instructions
3. Add the MCP server URL in the Tools section
4. Add the tool names under the server
4. Select which tools from the server to enable for your agent in action

<Info>
You can add multiple MCP servers to the same agent if needed.
</Info>

### Example MCP Tool Definition

```python
@mcp_tool(name="get_weather", description="Fetches current weather for a given city")
async def get_weather(city: str) -> dict:
    ...
```

Agentix will introspect the tool and make it callable via the assistant.

## Tool Readiness Matrix

| Tool Type     | Definition Location | Setup Required | Usage Mode |
|---------------|---------------------|----------------|-------------|
| Built-in Tools | Agentix core runtime | None | Immediate |
| MCP Tools     | External MCP server | Define tool + connect server | Pulled at runtime |
