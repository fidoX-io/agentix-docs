## 🛡️ Permission Model

### 🔒 Access Control

- Role-based interface: users only see what they’re allowed to  
- Workflows can limit task access per user or role  
- Admin-only areas are locked down from Job-Hub users  

### 🔍 Auditing & Data Security

- All user actions are logged and traceable  
- Personally identifiable data access is role-scoped  
- API access follows the same permission boundaries
