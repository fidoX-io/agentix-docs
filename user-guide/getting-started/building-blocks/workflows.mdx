##  Definition

**Workflows** define the overall **flow and orchestration logic** of a customer journey. They connect **PowerLinks**, **Actions**, **Agents** and **Tools** into complete experiences that span from start to finish.

Each Workflow acts as a **visual program**, enabling you to automate complex logic, guide users and handle multiple outcomes using intuitive drag-and-drop blocks.

You build workflows visually using the **Workflow Designer**.

*A sample workflow with single step.*

## What Workflows Do

Workflows determine:

- ✅ When to trigger each **Action** of specific **PowerLink**
- 🔁 Sequence of data flow between steps
- 🔐 Whether login is required and which type (PIN, OTP, Google)
- 📣 How notifications are sent via WhatsApp, Email or SMS
- 🎯 Completion rules and fallback handling for the journey

You can think of a Workflow as the **orchestration layer** that gives structure, logic and intelligence to your customer experiences.

## Key Configuration

Each Workflow includes:

### 🔐 Login Requirements

You can define whether the customer needs to log in before starting the journey. Supported login methods include:

- PIN Code  
- One-Time Password (OTP)  
- Google Authentication  

You can also configure session timeout, retry limits and lockout duration.

### 📣 Notification Settings

Customize how and when notifications are sent for LaunchPad triggers or login codes via:

- WhatsApp  
- SMS  
- Email  

Each channel can be independently toggled and tailored.

### 🧱 Workflow Studio

Use the drag-and-drop **Studio** to:

- Build your workflow with PowerLinks, actions and conditions  
- Define branching logic based on forms, tool results or user input  
- Assign AI or human agents to each action  
- Visually preview your journey before publishing

## Example Use Cases

<Card title="Onboarding Workflow" horizontal>
  A multi-step flow that asks users to upload ID, verify details and receive approval using both Task and Realtime agents.
</Card>

<Card title="Support Escalation" horizontal>
  A guided workflow that starts with self-service answers, then escalates to live chat if issues aren't resolved.
</Card>

<Card title="Loan Application" horizontal>
  A conditional workflow with eligibility checks, document uploads and AI-based approval logic.
</Card>

## Best Practices

- Break complex journeys into modular **PowerLinks**
- Keep each **Action** focused and purpose-driven
- Use fallback flows for error handling and re-engagement
- Reuse tools and prompts across different workflows
- Analyze job and task performance to improve step logic
