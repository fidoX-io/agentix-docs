## Definition
In Agentix, **Agents** refer exclusively to **AI-powered assistants** that perform tasks during a customer journey. Agents are assigned to specific **Actions** and their behavior is driven by prompts, tools, knowledge sources and contextual data.

They automate complex steps, provide guidance, interact with users in real time and invoke external tools to achieve goals within a workflow.

*A sample overview of the different Agents available in Agentix.*

## What AI Agents Can Do

- 🧾 **Follow Prompts** – Execute structured instructions defined per Action  
- 🛠️ **Invoke Tools** – Trigger APIs, file processors or custom scripts  
- 📚 **Use Knowledge Sources** – Access connected documents or databases to answer user queries  
- 💬 **Multimodal Interaction** – Support chat, voice, video, document previews and form inputs  


## Agent Types

Agentix supports two types of AI agents, each tailored for different execution modes:

### 📄 Task Agents

- Handle **asynchronous**, one-time tasks  
- No live session—run in the background  
- Ideal for tasks like form handling, file validation or backend data operations  
- Return structured output upon completion  

### 🎙️ Realtime Agents

- Join **live sessions** (chat, voice or video)  
- Listen, respond and act in real time  
- Can show images, preview documents, ask for uploads and collect form inputs  
- Perfect for conversational flows and interactive support  

> 🧩 Both types use the same configuration model but differ in how and when they are executed.



## Bundled with PowerLinks

Each **PowerLink** may include one or more **predefined AI agents** tailored to its function:

- The **Realtime PowerLink** comes with a ready-to-use Realtime Agent  
- The **Media Upload PowerLink** includes a Task Agent to process files  
- You can customize these agents’ prompts, tools and knowledge access  

This modular design lets you plug AI behaviors directly into workflows without rebuilding from scratch.

You can further extend agents by assigning custom tools, integrating with external systems and fine-tuning their prompts based on workflow needs.
