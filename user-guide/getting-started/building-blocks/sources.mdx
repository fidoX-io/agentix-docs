## Definition
**Sources** in Agentix provide content and context that AI agents can display, reference or use to collect input from users. They help agents act intelligently and visually—whether through showing a file, retrieving information or prompting the user to fill in structured data.



## Types of Sources

Agentix supports three main types of Sources:

### 📄 Static Files

Files that the agent can use for:

- **Displaying visual content** to the user (e.g. welcome images, banners)  
- **Sending downloadable documents** (e.g. invoices, brochures, instructions)  
- **Referencing silently** during decision-making or tool execution  

✅ Useful for: product visuals, legal disclaimers, price lists or how-to guides.


### 🧠 KB Sources (RAG)

RAG-enabled **Knowledge Base (KB) Sources** allow agents to dynamically retrieve and cite relevant information when answering user questions.

Supported types:

- **📄 Uploaded documents** (PDF, DOCX, TXT)  
- **🌐 Website URLs** (crawl and embed structured pages)  
- **🧾 Structured entries** (FAQs or indexed data via metadata)  
- **🌍 Multi-language support** and **metadata filters**  

These KB sources are indexed and embedded using advanced chunking strategies to support accurate-contextual retrieval.

✅ Ideal for: policies, terms, service descriptions, internal documentation.


### 📝 Forms

Forms are structured sources used by agents to:

- **Request specific user inputs** (e.g. name, phone number, ID type)  
- **Collect and validate data** before moving to the next action  
- **Trigger follow-up tools or decisions** based on the form result  

Forms can appear during live interactions or be triggered inside a task step.

✅ Ideal for: lead capture, appointment booking, document submission.


## How Sources Are Used

Sources are assigned to **Actions** and are used depending on the interaction context:

- A **Realtime Agent** can show a file or ask the user to fill a form  
- A **Task Agent** may silently pull KB data to write or summarize something  
- Any AI agent can access RAG responses if a KB Source is configured


## Best Practices

- Use **clear names and tags** for static files for easy reference  
- Group related files or forms by topic or action type  
- Regularly **update KB Sources** to keep responses aligned with current info  
- Keep forms short and focused for better user experience
