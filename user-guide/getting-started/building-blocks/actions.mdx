## Definition
**Actions** are the smallest configurable units of a customer journey in Agentix. Each Action represents a specific **step** in the flow and is tied to a **PowerLink**.

Think of an Action as a **configured instance** of a PowerLink, enriched with the logic, agents, prompts and conditions needed for execution.

## What an Action Includes

Each Action can be configured with:

- üë§ **Performer** ‚Äì Who executes the step: AI agent, human agent or customer  
- üõ†Ô∏è **Tools & Sources** ‚Äì APIs, file processors and knowledge bases used for processing or decision making  
- üß† **Instruction Prompt** ‚Äì Custom prompt that guides how the AI should behave during execution  

Actions are placed inside **Workflows** and they‚Äôre what actually get executed during a job.

<Note>
*In addition to assigning AI-Agent, configuring instructions, sources and tools, user have several agent and application configurations available based on the selected agent and powerlink*
</Note>

## Example Use Cases

- A **Realtime Action** using an AI agent to answer questions via voice  
- A **Media Upload Action** that requests the user to submit a file for analysis  
- A **MasterMind Action** that routes the journey based on submitted form data  

## Why Actions Matter

Actions bring PowerLinks to life inside workflows. They:

- Define **who does what**, **when** and **how**  
- Provide full **control and customization** at every step  
- Allow you to design **tailored instruction prompts** for AI agents  
- Make workflows **modular, scalable and easy to iterate**  

In short, **Actions are the execution logic** of your PowerLinks within a workflow.
