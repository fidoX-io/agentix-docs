## Definition
A **Job** in Agentix represents a **complete execution** of a workflow for a specific customer, session or case.

Jobs allow you to manage and monitor the entire journey from start to finish, including:

- 🔑 A unique **job key** to track the session  
- 🧭 The associated **workflow and actions**  
- 🧾 All **collected data** and user inputs  
- 📈 The **execution status** and outcome  
- 🗂️ All related **tasks, agents and tools** used  

Jobs are created when a user launches a Workflow and continue until it completes.

## What Jobs Contain

- A reference to the selected **workflow**
- Metadata such as creation time, user ID or launch context
- A dynamic state that updates as each Task is completed
- The timeline of **all steps**, inputs and outputs
