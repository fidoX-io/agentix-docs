## Definition
A **Task** is a single step inside a Job that needs to be performed by an AI agent, a human user or a system.

Each Task is created from a Workflow **Action** and includes the input, logic and expected outcome for that specific step.


## What Tasks Do

- Represent a **unit of work** inside the larger journey 
- Represents a specific action to be taken, like uploading a document or speaking with an agent
- Can be handled by **Realtime** or **Task Agents**  
- Carry all necessary **input/output**, instructions and agent configuration  
- Are tracked for **status**, execution time and result  
- Trigger assigned **tools** and use assigned **sources**


## Common Task Examples

- Upload and verify a document  
- Join a video call with an AI agent  
- Fill out a form with guided AI support  
- Analyze an invoice and extract data  
- Route a case based on form values
