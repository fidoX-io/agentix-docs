## What is Agentix?

A no-code orchestration platform for designing, managing and launching intelligent customer journeys—combining **self-service**, **guided** and **automated** experiences, all without writing a single line of code.

These journeys are built using modular, reusable app templates called **PowerLinks**—designed for web, voice, chat and media-driven interactions. Each step in the journey is defined as an **Action**, which can be handled by an AI, a human agent or the customer themselves.

Agentix enables seamless handoffs between automation, AI and human interaction within a single flow—ensuring a consistent, intelligent experience from start to finish. Everything is managed through an intuitive control panel built for speed, flexibility and scale.

## Why Agentix?

Modern customer journeys are no longer linear. Users expect fast answers, seamless transitions and real results—whether they're talking to an AI, filling out a form or chatting with a human agent.

In today’s fast-moving landscape, customer experience is no longer a back-office concern—it’s a strategic differentiator. Teams are expected to deliver seamless, intelligent interactions across channels—while balancing automation with human empathy.

But most processes today are fragmented:
- 🤖 AI handles one part of the flow.
- 🧑‍💼 Human agents step in on another system.
- 👤 The customer gets lost—waiting, repeating themselves or falling through the cracks.

**Agentix was built to fix this.**

It unifies **AI**, **human agents**, **automation** and the **customer** into one seamless journey:

- ✅ **Customers become stakeholders**, actively participating in the delivery process.
- 🔁 **AI and humans collaborate**, with context-aware, intelligent handoffs.
- 🔗 **No more broken steps**, disconnected tools or fragmented experiences.

Agentix ensures your flows stay **smart**, **adaptive** and **human**—all orchestrated through an intuitive control panel, without writing a single line of code.


## What Makes Agentix Different?
