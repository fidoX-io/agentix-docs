# Decision Engine Configuration

Configure the Mastermind's AI-powered decision engine to handle complex business logic and automated decision making.

## Decision Models

### Rule-Based Decisions

Create structured decision trees with clear logic paths:

```yaml
decision_rules:
  - name: "Credit Approval"
    conditions:
      - credit_score: ">= 650"
      - income: ">= 50000"
      - debt_ratio: "<= 0.4"
    action: "approve"
  - name: "Manual Review Required"
    conditions:
      - credit_score: "500-649"
      - income: ">= 40000"
    action: "manual_review"
  - name: "Auto Decline"
    conditions:
      - credit_score: "< 500"
    action: "decline"
```

## Input Processing

### Data Sources

Configure multiple input channels:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Structured Data">
    - Database queries
    - API endpoints
    - CSV/Excel files
    - Form submissions
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Unstructured Data">
    - Document analysis
    - Email content
    - Social media feeds
    - Audio transcriptions
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Real-time Streams">
    - IoT sensor data
    - Live chat conversations
    - System monitoring feeds
    - Transaction streams
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

### Data Validation

<Note>
All input data is validated against defined schemas before processing.
</Note>

```json
{
  "validation_schema": {
    "customer_data": {
      "required_fields": ["id", "name", "email"],
      "data_types": {
        "id": "integer",
        "name": "string",
        "email": "email",
        "score": "float"
      },
      "constraints": {
        "score": "0 <= value <= 100"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## Decision Outcomes

### Action Types

Define what happens when decisions are made:

1. **Automated Actions**
   - Send notifications
   - Update databases
   - Trigger workflows
   - Execute API calls

2. **Human-in-the-Loop**
   - Escalate to managers
   - Request additional information
   - Schedule follow-up tasks
   - Generate reports

3. **System Integration**
   - Update CRM records
   - Process payments
   - Generate documents
   - Log audit trails

## Performance Monitoring

### Decision Accuracy

Track the performance of your decision engine:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Accuracy Metrics">
    Monitor correct vs incorrect decisions over time
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Confidence Scores">
    Track how confident the AI is in its decisions
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Processing Time">
    Measure decision latency and throughput
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Error Rates">
    Identify and address decision failures
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### Continuous Learning

<Warning>
Regular model retraining is recommended to maintain decision accuracy as conditions change.
</Warning>

- Feedback loops from decision outcomes
- A/B testing of different decision models
- Performance comparison across time periods
- Model versioning and rollback capabilities
