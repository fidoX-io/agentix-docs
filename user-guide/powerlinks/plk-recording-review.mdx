The **Recording Analyzer** PowerLink provides an **AI-powered review layer** for analyzing recorded conversations such as calls, meetings, voice memos or uploaded audio files. It converts speech to text, extracts insights, applies a customizable evaluation rubric  and generates structured reports for downstream automation or compliance.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è This PowerLink runs automatically and does not interact with the user. It can be used to analyze **any pre-recorded audio or video**, whether from a real-time session or external upload.

## How it Works

This PowerLink processes one or more uploaded recording files as input. Each input must be provided with a type of `MEDIA`  and may contain either audio or video content. The agent performs transcription, applies AI-based evaluation and summarization  and then generates structured QA reports ‚Äî one for each file. It‚Äôs fully automated and non-interactive.

<Check>
Once the media files are provided, the PowerLink transcribes each one individually, applies the evaluation rubric  and generates both HTML and JSON reports for downstream review.
</Check>

<Note>
Ensure that each file input is set with type `MEDIA`. You can upload multiple recordings in the same job ‚Äî each will be analyzed independently.  
For best transcription results, the recording‚Äôs **spoken language locale** should match the expected input for your selected STT model (e.g., `en-US`, `ar-SA`).
</Note>
