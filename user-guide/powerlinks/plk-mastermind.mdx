The **Mastermind** PowerLink is an AI-powered decision-making engine designed to analyze inputs and predefined instructions, then produce a decision and output for the next task. It is ideal for automating AI evaluation flows, branching logic and structured business decisions.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è This PowerLink is fully automated and non-interactive. It runs silently in the background to power downstream actions.

## How it Works

This PowerLink uses the **Decision Maker Agent** to analyze input fields, instructions, tools and context. It outputs a structured result and determines what the next task should be. It runs silently and can be used to automate reviews, AI flows or intelligent handoffs.

<Check>
Just provide the input (such as a transcript, form or analysis result) and the agent will make a decision and prepare the output for the next task ‚Äî no manual steps needed.
</Check>

<Note>
The decisions can be limited to predefined actions using the `ACTIONS` parameter. This allows controlled automation based on your business logic.
</Note>

## Agents

  Here is list of available agents that can be used with this PowerLink. Each agent has its own set of parameters that can be configured to suit your use-case.
