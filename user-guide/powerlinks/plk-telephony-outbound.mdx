The Outbound Dialer PowerLink acts as an **automated dispatcher** for outbound phone calls. It manages dialing logic, enforces concurrency limits and initiates the call process. Once a call is ready to be placed, it hands over control to the **next real-time task** ‚Äî typically a PowerLink involving a human or AI voice agent who interacts with the customer.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è This PowerLink **must be followed** by a real-time interaction step (e.g., AI agent, human agent, co-browsing) in the same workflow. It does **not handle the call conversation itself**, only the call dispatch.

It‚Äôs ideal for lead outreach, reminders or surveys ‚Äî where the system needs to trigger real-time calls in a controlled and scalable way.

## How it Works in the Background

This PowerLink operates without any user-facing interface. It runs automatically in the background to initiate the outbound call and manage its scheduling.

There is no screen shown to the customer at this stage ‚Äî the call is simply placed when a slot is available and the workflow proceeds to the next real-time interaction task once the call is connected.

<Check>
Once the outbound call is successfully placed, the job moves automatically to the real-time step for the customer interaction.
</Check>

<Note>
If the maximum number of concurrent outbound calls is reached, this task will **wait for an available slot** and retry automatically. This ensures controlled pacing of outbound dialing.
</Note>

<Danger>
If the system is unable to place the call ‚Äî for example, due to an **invalid number**, repeated **unanswered attempts** or **all retry attempts being exhausted** ‚Äî the job will be marked as **rejected** and the workflow will not proceed unless designed to handle this case.
</Danger>

## Prerequisites

This PowerLink uses the **customer‚Äôs mobile number** from the job context to place the outbound call.


<Info>
The mobile number used for dialing is retrieved from the **customer record** at the time the job is created (e.g., <code>customer.mobile</code>). Ensure the customer profile includes a valid phone number.
</Info>

<Danger>
If the customer‚Äôs mobile number is missing or invalid, the task will be **automatically rejected** and the workflow will not proceed unless explicitly designed to handle this failure.
</Danger>

## Use Cases

- AI outbound calling campaigns
- Human agent callbacks
- Appointment confirmation calls
- Voice-based surveys or feedback collection

## Getting Started

<Steps>

<Step title="Create Action from Outbound Dialer PowerLink">
After installing the PowerLink, go to **PowerLinks** in your cPanel, select **Actions** and click **Create New Action**.
</Step>

<Step title="Configure Prompt Message">
Customize the optional `USER_PROMPT` that appears while the system is placing the call.
</Step>

<Step title="Attach Realtime PowerLink After It">
In your workflow, this action must be **immediately followed** by a real-time interaction PowerLink ‚Äî such as AI Voice Agent, Human Agent Panel or Co-Browsing session.

</Step>

<Step title="Test the Call Flow">
Use **LaunchPad Runner** to simulate a complete job flow. Confirm the dialer dispatches the call and the next real-time task begins as expected.
