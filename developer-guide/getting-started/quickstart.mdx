  <Card title="Trigger Jobs via API" icon="code" href="/developer-guide/api/create-job">
  External systems (like CRMs, ticketing platforms, or web apps) can trigger new jobs in Agentix by calling the **Create Job API**.  
  This is often set up through a webhook or event listener.
  </Card>

  <Card title="Extend with MCP Tools" icon="wrench" href="/developer-guide/mcp-tools">
  Build custom tools using the **Model Context Protocol (MCP)** to give agents new abilities â€” such as querying databases, fetching customer records or executing workflows on external systems.
