Authentication is required for all Agentix API requests. This guide covers how to obtain and use API credentials to securely access the platform.

## API Key Authentication

Agentix uses API key-based authentication for secure access to the platform. You'll need to generate an API key from your cPanel to make authenticated requests.

### Getting Your API Key

<Steps>
<Step title="Access cPanel">
Log in to your [Agentix cPanel](https://launch.agentixhub.ai/cpanel) using your account credentials.
</Step>

<Step title="Navigate to API Settings">
Go to **Settings** â†’ **API Keys** in the main navigation menu.
</Step>

<Step title="Generate New API Key">
Click **Generate New API Key** and provide a descriptive name for your key (e.g., "Production API", "Development Testing").
</Step>

<Step title="Copy and Store Securely">
Copy the generated API key immediately and store it securely. You won't be able to view it again.
</Step>
</Steps>

## Making Authenticated Requests

Include your API key in all requests using the `Authorization` header:

```bash
curl -X GET "https://api.agentixhub.ai/v1/tasks" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json"
```

### Request Headers

| Header | Value | Required |
|--------|-------|----------|
| `Authorization` | `Bearer YOUR_API_KEY` | Yes |
| `Content-Type` | `application/json` | Yes |

## Security Best Practices

<Warning>
Keep your API keys secure and never expose them in client-side code or public repositories.
</Warning>

### Environment Variables
Store API keys as environment variables:

```bash
export AGENTIX_API_KEY="your_api_key_here"
```

### Rate Limiting
API requests are rate-limited to ensure platform stability:
- **Standard Plan**: 1,000 requests per hour
- **Professional Plan**: 5,000 requests per hour
- **Enterprise Plan**: Custom limits

### Key Rotation
Regularly rotate your API keys for enhanced security:
- Generate new keys before old ones expire
- Update all applications with new credentials
- Revoke old keys after successful migration

## Error Handling

### Authentication Errors

| Status Code | Error | Description |
|-------------|-------|-------------|
| `401` | Unauthorized | Invalid or missing API key |
| `403` | Forbidden | API key lacks required permissions |
| `429` | Too Many Requests | Rate limit exceeded |

### Example Error Response

```json
{
  "error": {
    "code": "INVALID_API_KEY",
    "message": "The provided API key is invalid or expired",
    "details": "Please check your API key and try again"
  }
}
```
