## Overview

The Create Job API allows you to programmatically create new customer journey jobs in Agentix. This endpoint is the primary way to initiate automated workflows through the Agentix platform.

## How It Works

When you create a job through the API:

1. **Workflow Assignment**: Specify which workflow ID to execute
2. **Customer Data**: Provide customer information (name, mobile, email, etc.)
3. **Job Configuration**: Set expiration time, language, and metadata
4. **Input Parameters**: Pass dynamic data to customize the workflow execution

## Key Concepts

### Workflow ID
Every job must be associated with a pre-configured workflow in your Agentix dashboard. The workflow defines the customer journey steps and automation logic.

### Expiration Time
Jobs have a validity period (`validUntil`) specified in seconds. After this time, the job becomes inaccessible to customers.

### Customer Information
Provide customer details to personalize the experience and enable agent handoffs when needed.

### Dynamic Inputs
Use the `input` array to pass variable data that workflows can utilize for personalization and decision-making.

## Authentication

All API requests require authentication using your API key in the `x-api-key` header.

<Info>
**Getting your API Key:** Contact your organization administrator to generate an Integration API key. Only administrators can create API keys.
