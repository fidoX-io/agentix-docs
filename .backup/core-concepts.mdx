These foundational building blocks explain how Agentix structures and powers intelligent customer journeys‚Äîfrom modular flows to AI agents and real-time task execution.

---

## ‚ö° PowerLinks

**PowerLinks** are reusable, modular building blocks that define how users interact with your service‚Äîwhether through **self-service**, **guided** or **automated** flows.

Each PowerLink focuses on a specific type of interaction‚Äîlike media uploads, live support, outbound campaigns and more. You can assign tools, agents and custom logic to control what happens inside each one.

### Characteristics
PowerLinks are:

- üîå **Reusable** ‚Äì Designed to be plugged into different workflows without rewriting logic  
- üß© **Composable** ‚Äì Can be combined to form complete, multi-step customer journeys  
- üß† **Dynamic** ‚Äì Can work with AI, human agents or the user directly  
- üéØ **Purposeful** ‚Äì Each PowerLink has a clearly defined function and input/output behavior  

### Types

Agentix offers three main types of PowerLinks:

- **üßç Self-Service** ‚Äì Interactions performed directly by the customer, such as uploading documents or submitting a form  
- **ü§ñ Automated** ‚Äì Actions handled entirely by the system or an AI agent without human involvement  
- **üë• Guided** ‚Äì Steps where a human or AI agent guides or assists the customer through the interaction  

You can mix and match PowerLinks of any type to create powerful, seamless experiences.

> üëâ See [PowerLinks Catalog](/user-guide/powerlinks/catalogue) to explore available types.

## üß© Actions

**Actions** are the smallest configurable units of a customer journey. Each Action represents a **step** in the flow and is tied to a specific **PowerLink**.

You can think of an Action as an **instance of a PowerLink**‚Äîfully configured with:
- The **agent** (AI, human or customer) responsible for execution  
- The **input or output** required (form, document, audio, etc.)  
- The **tool or source** used for processing or guidance  
- The **instruction prompt** to guide AI behavior (if executed by an AI agent)  
- The **next step** in the journey after completion  

Actions are placed inside **Workflows**, where they become the actual steps customers, AI or agents interact with.

### Example Use Cases

- An Action using the **Realtime** PowerLink with an AI agent to answer questions  
- A **Media Upload** Action that asks the customer to submit a document  
- A **MasterMind** Action that calls an AI to make a routing decision based on form data  

### Why Actions Matter

- They define **who does what**, **when** and **how**  
- They give you full **control and flexibility** over each step  
- They enable tailored **instruction prompts** for precise AI behavior  
- They make journeys modular and easy to iterate on  

In short, **Actions bring PowerLinks to life** inside your workflows.

## ü§ñ Agents

In Agentix, **Agents** refer specifically to **AI-powered assistants** that handle various parts of a customer journey. They are assigned to specific **Actions** and operate based on system prompts, contextual data and available tools.

Agents automate complex tasks, guide users, trigger tools and ensure consistent-intelligent interaction across different channels.

### What AI Agents Can Do

- üß† **Follow Prompts** ‚Äì Execute structured instructions defined per action or use case  
- üß∞ **Invoke Tools** ‚Äì Trigger APIs, file processors, lookups and other tools to complete tasks  
- üìö **Use Knowledge Sources** ‚Äì Reference documents and knowledge bases for dynamic answers  
- üó£Ô∏è **Multimodal** ‚Äì Support chat, voice, video, forms and documents depending on the PowerLink  

---

### Types of Agents

Agentix supports **two types of AI Agents**, each suited for a different interaction style:

#### üìÑ Task Agents

- Handle **asynchronous**, one-time actions (e.g. form handling, file review, document extraction)  
- Operate **in the background** with no real-time session  
- Return output once the task is complete  

#### üéôÔ∏è Realtime Agents

- Join **live sessions** via **voice**, **chat** or **video**  
- Continuously **listen, respond and act** during the session  
- Can **show images**, **ask for file uploads** and **collect form inputs** in real time  
- Ideal for **conversational guidance**, **interactive workflows** and **visual assistance**

> Both types share the same configuration model, but differ in execution mode and communication channel.

---

### üì¶ Agents Are Bundled with PowerLinks

Each **PowerLink** comes with one or more **predefined AI agents** tailored to its function.

- For example, the **Realtime PowerLink** comes with a prebuilt **Realtime Agent** ready for voice or chat.
- The **Media Upload PowerLink** includes a **Task Agent** that automatically analyzes submitted content.
- These agents are fully configurable‚Äîyou can customize their behavior, prompts, tools and knowledge access per use case.

This modular design allows you to plug-and-play AI behavior without rebuilding from scratch.

### üß© Types of Agents

Agentix supports **two types of AI Agents**, each suited for a different interaction style:

#### üìÑ Task Agents

- Handle **asynchronous**, one-time actions (e.g. form handling, file review, document extraction)  
- Operate **in the background** with no real-time session  
- Return output once the task is complete  

#### üéôÔ∏è Realtime Agents

- Join **live sessions** (voice or chat) and interact with users in real time  
- Continuously listen, respond and take action during the session  
- Suitable for conversational guidance, live support or interactive flows  

> üîÅ Both types share the same configuration model, but differ in execution mode and communication channel.

## üéØ Workflows

Workflows define the **logic and flow** of a full customer journey.

A workflow determines:

- When to trigger PowerLinks and which Action to run  
- How data moves between steps  
- Escalation rules, branching conditions, fallback handling  
- Completion criteria and follow-up behavior  

Workflows are visualized and built using the **Workflow Designer**‚Äîa no-code drag-and-drop interface.

---

## ÔøΩÔ∏è Tools & Sources

External helpers and integrations that enrich or support the flow:

- **Tools** ‚Äì API calls, file processors, form handlers or custom logic runners  
- **Sources** ‚Äì Connected knowledge bases or documents the AI can use to answer questions  
- **MCP Tools** ‚Äì Model Context Protocol services you can define and plug into flows for contextual AI behavior  

These resources can be assigned to AI agents and used within Actions.

---

## ÔøΩ Jobs & Tasks

A **Job** represents one full execution of a workflow for a specific user or case.

Jobs:

- Contain all the data collected during the journey  
- Track the full state of the process  
- Can include both automated and manual steps  
- Are assigned to one or more agents depending on the journey design  

Each job has a unique key and full execution history.

### ‚úÖ Tasks

A **Task** is a specific action within a Job that requires someone (AI or human) to do something.

- Created automatically based on the Workflow and Actions  
- Assigned to an agent or user for execution  
- Can involve form input, validation, document uploads, voice or chat sessions  
- Completed steps move the Job forward  

Tasks are the **micro-units** of work inside a journey.
